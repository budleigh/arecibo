SPA/webapp template with front-end and back-end boilerplate using Flask, Pewee and Vue

- Uses a Flask app as an initial web backend and for an API module. The Flask app serves the root page, where Vue takes over and interacts with the app's API.
- The backend is set up with crude User models and authentication. The frontend is set up to interact with the auth backend.
- The Vue frontend is configured with vue-router and vuex state management.
